# openimg

openimg (Open Image) is a set of JavaScript packages for working with images on the web. It includes a React component, server-side code for Node and Bun, and a Vite plugin. Every part is built to work smoothly together, but you can also use them individually. You can find [the full documentation on Gitub](https://github.com/andrelandgraf/openimg).

# openimg-node

openimg-node is available as a standalone package in case you only want to use the server-side utilities for Node. However, for most use cases, you probably want to install `openimg` instead of `openimg-node`.
