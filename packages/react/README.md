# openimg-react

openimg-react (Open Image React) provides an Image component (aliased as Img) for querying optimized images from an image optimization endpoint (e.g., openimg-node). The component uses standard HTML img element attributes to generate a picture element with sources for avif and webp images in different sizes.
